# Breast Cancer Prediction

## Introduction
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file (`breast_prediction.ipynb`) and a dataset (`data.csv`) for predicting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to build a model that can predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on certain features.

## Dataset
The dataset (`data.csv`) contains various features that are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The dataset includes both numerical and categorical features.

## Notebook Overview
The Jupyter Notebook (`breast_prediction.ipynb`) guides through the process of:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Exploring the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the distribution of features, correlations, and visualizing relationships between variables.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying important features for model training.
4. **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, etc.) for breast cancer prediction.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques such as cross-validation.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters to improve performance.
7. **Results Interpretation**: Interpreting the model results and discussing their implications.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, the following Python libraries are required:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

These can be installed via pip or conda.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip` or `conda`.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`breast_prediction.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions and execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.
